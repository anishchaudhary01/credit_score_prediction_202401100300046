credit score prediction
A credit score prediction project is a great idea! Here's a basic outline of what you can write in your GitHub repository:  

### **Project: Credit Score Prediction Using Machine Learning**  

#### **Description**  
This project aims to predict the credit score of individuals based on their financial history and other relevant features using machine learning models. The dataset includes details like income, debt, credit history, and payment behavior.  

#### **Features**  
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features)  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature selection & engineering  
- Training various ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)  
- Model evaluation using accuracy, F1-score, and AUC-ROC  
- Deployment using Flask or FastAPI (optional)  

#### **Installation**  
1. Clone the repo:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-score-prediction.git
   cd credit-score-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

#### **Usage**  
```sh
python train_model.py
```
To run the web API (if implemented):  
```sh
python app.py
```

#### **Technologies Used**  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)  
- Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Flask/FastAPI (for API deployment)  
- Jupyter Notebook (for EDA)
